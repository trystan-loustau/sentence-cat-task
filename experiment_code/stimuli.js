// this is where you can put any stimuli you want to use in your experiment, 
// you don't HAVE to put your stimuli here, but it can be useful for organization!

// example below: 

const introduction_page = `
<h1>Welcome to the experiment!</h1>
<p>I'm some text! I'm <b>pretty cool<b>! I could be more complicated but I'm just text!</p>
`;
